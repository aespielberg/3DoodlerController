shape and color of large fragile objects under non-laboratory conditions.
Our system employs laser triangulation rangefinders, laser
time-of-flight rangefinders, digital still cameras, and a suite of software
for acquiring, aligning, merging, and viewing scanned data.
As a demonstration of this system, we digitized 10 statues by
Michelangelo, including the well-known figure of David, two building
interiors, and all 1,163 extant fragments of the Forma Urbis
Romae, a giant marble map of ancient Rome. Our largest single
dataset is of the David - 2 billion polygons and 7,000 color images.
In this paper,we discuss the challenges we faced in building this
system, the solutions we employed, and the lessons we learned. We
focus in particular on the unusual design of our laser triangulation
scanner and on the algorithms and software we developed for handling
very large scanned models."

    abstract = { In the context of the Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) of ETH Zurich, the Professorship for Architecture and Digital Fabrication of Fabio Gramazio and Matthias Kohler has set up a robotic laboratory to investigate the potentials of non-standard robotic fabrication for high rise constructions in Singapore. The high degree of industrialisation of this dominant building typology implies standardisation, simplification and repetition and accounts for the increasing monotony evident in many Asian metropolises. The aim of this research on material systems for robotic construction is to develop a new and competitive construction method that makes full use of the malleable potential of concrete as a building material. A novel, spatial, robotic "weaving" method of a tensile active material that simultaneously acts as the form defining mould, folds two separate aspects of concrete-reinforcement and formwork-into one single robotic fabrication process (see Figure 1). This in-situ process could permit the fabrication of structurally differentiated, spatially articulated and material efficient buildings. }
